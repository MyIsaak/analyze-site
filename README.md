### Introduction

Feel-the-web is a free cross-platform browser extension allows marketers and students to view, or 'feel', sentiments from websites. It highlights all positive in green, neutral in yellow and negative in red, directly on the webpage itself.

### What is sentiment analysis?

The process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.

### How feel-the-web works?

Using [Google's Natural Language REST API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) feel-the-web sends the webpage to their trained neural-network based model which performs sentiment analysis for the extension to receive. This external machine is hosted on their cloud, payed by my own pockets so don't go wild... unless you make a donation :)

Using [Mozilla's WebExtensions Framework](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) feel-the-web can be supported by Chrome, Firefox and Opera as well as the [W3C Community Group](https://browserext.github.io/browserext/)
